            33 possible appearances. Aaron Jones is probably losing his job to AJ Dillon at some point. Etienne missed his rookie year. Sanders
            didn't score a TD last year. That's a fair list of issues in her top 4 RBs. CeeDee is a stud, but DJ Moore is dealing with maybe
            the most dysfunctional team in the NFL and counting on Bateman for #2 is pretty tough. If Olave takes off and JRob bounces back in
            full, this team could feel a lot better, but again. More question marks.`

            That is 50 points every week, without exaggeration. Going down the line, the top 2 RB situation is tricky, with Cam Akers 
            being on a finicky Rams team and JK Dobbins needing to rebound from surgery in a big way. Sutton will be a stud this year, we
            recommend Brett Kollman's video on Russ's playstyle being tailor made for for Sutton. Freiermuth is eh, but depth is legitamately

            The depth is really strong too. As for why only 5, its a competitive year, and Robinson at WR2 instead of flex really makes us feel
            shaky about the week to week production here, especially when the flex options are decent, but not confidently good. Still, a very, very

                    And we're back! <br/>
                    <br/>
                    After an eventful 2021 season with Our Holy Commish suspiciously winning the league, we return for a 2022 season sure to be
                    filled with drama, choking, hot streaks, massages, plastic surgery, and trash talk. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Draft day was a resounding success, creating a slate of teams that, unlike last year, feel like they all can take off at a
                    moments notice or crash and burn spectacularly. Each team has at least 1 soft spot, a distinct stregnth that will stand 
                    against everyone else, and a not terrible bench. Even Mike avoided Blake Jarwin this year!<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Basically, we're trying to rinse ourselves of blame if we're horrifically wrong in power rankings compared to last years. 
                    There are genuinely no bad teams, and no one completely overpowered team.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Before we jump into power rankings, though, let's take a crack at who we think will highlight this year, after an offseason
                    of endless trades, retirements, free agent movement, suspensions, and new coaching hires. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>MVP: Najee Harris:</b> Between JT and Najee, Najee is on a team with a worse offense, worse QB, and worse RB2. A recipe
                    for fantasy success for the year 2 back. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>ROY: Breece Hall:</b> Zach Wilson is coming off a knee injury and will probably need some time to get going. 
                    A Shanahan/Lafluer system mixed with a revamped OL makes this the safest ROY bet. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>MIP: Justin Jefferson:</b> JJ was no slouch last year, as he was the #4 receiver in fantasy. But we see him taking a leap
                    in this Kevin O'Connell offense (think 2021 Cooper Kupp but not white) to be #1 - and it won't be close either.
