        game: "L 112.26",
        upcoming: "Bare Butt Balls and Back (3-3)",
        blurb: `Back to back tough weeks sees Shiv slide down even further, this time with a sub-100 point loss. The Pack just can't seem to get
        Aaron Jones going properly, Jalen Hurts didn't play out of his mind, and the TE stream was unfortunate. Just overall an underwhelming week
        with a team she needed some overacheivement from. A tough BYE this upcoming week doesn't seem to be doing her any favors.`

        up: "Zach Ertz",
        down: "Curtis Samuel",
        game: "W 101.24",
        upcoming: "Î½Î¯ÎºÎ· (0-6)",
        blurb: `Fraudulence abounds as Danny scores barely anything and still wins somehow. The only real duds this week were Rodgers, who ran
        into the buzzsaw that is Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams, and Curtis Samuel, though. So it's not really an ugly performace. Pretty
        good balance aside from that, and like Nandan, 5 wins in 6 games makes not making the playoffs a tough sell. In this case, however, we
        think it's pretty much a lock at this point. The bench is way too good to see a proper collapse.`

        game: "L 94.92",
        upcoming: "Î²Î±Î²Î·ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Î£Î¥Î£Î¥ (3-3)",
        blurb: `Allan stays true to his season trend and turns in a sub-100 loss after a massive week, because obviously. Mike Williams embodied
        this more than anyone else on the team, and Higbee and Wilson also had tough weeks. We're seeing a cozy 6-7 for the season if this pattern
        keeps up, so until we see some consistency, this team is probably going to hang around here for some time.`

        game: "W 110.46",
        upcoming: "Joe mama (1-5)",
        blurb: `Another week of Allen and Diggs bailing this team out, with absolutely dire RB weeks. This team needs a magic RB pickup or buy-low
        trade to work out desperately. Still, a win is a win, and a 2W streak still counts for something. If Dobbins gains any form of consistency
        down the stretch, there's some hope here. But this week looks ugly with Buffalo's BYE looming. RIP in peace.`

        down: "Tee Higgins",
        game: "W 105.12",
        upcoming: "Kekeler Schmekelers (4-2)",
        blurb: `Even though he won, we're moving him down a spot to keep consistent with rewarding Mike with a win. It just didn't count in our eyes.
        The depth issues almost came for his soul, but he kept things going enough to eek out the "win". A returning D'Andre Swift should help, and 5
        wins in 6 games makes taking him out of the playoff discussion pretty hard. Still, an epic collapse wouldn't surprise us at all.`

        down: "Tyler Allgeier",
        game: "L 98.92",
        upcoming: "Daeivoantae's Inferno (5-1)",
        blurb: `Mike gets a bump because by all logic, this should have been a win. Herbert had thrown a TD pass in 23 straight games or something
        and averages 293 passing yards a game. Him having a just below career average game nets Mike a win. But something was up today, to the point
        where the books boosted Herbert to throw a TD to +100 from like -215 or something. Someone was interfering. This should have been a W, but
        instead, Mike remains the only winless team.`

        down: "Antonio Gibson",
        game: "W 135.88",
        upcoming: "CeeDeez Nutz in yo mouth (3-3)",
        blurb: `Logan has won 3 straight and has fully regressed to the mean. Even while hunting for QBs, this team has become a force, especially
        due to the ascension of Breece Hall. A returned Derrick Henry will make this team relentless. No other notes, really, he just needs a QB,
        maybe via trade, to really vault into best team in the league discussion.`

        down: "Elijah Moore",
        game: "W 142.80",
        upcoming: "Mixon deez (5-1)",
        blurb: `The defending champ claims #1 for the first time this season because we said so. Also, he notches another TOTW, is the league's
        lone 4-2 team, and is balanced enough to weather BYE shennanigans. Not to mention, there's an Elijah Mitchell-sized trick up his sleeve. 
        Ekeler, Pittman, and Andrews are the highlights this week, and look like they'll be the guys who carry this team to the playoffs and beyond if
        everyone else can just do enough. And if Elijah Moore finally sees a god damn target? Sheesh.`

        down: "Matt Stafford",
        game: "L 120.88",
        upcoming: "Cook-ing Spring Rolls (3-3)",
        blurb: `Between this 3-3 and Logan's we like Logan's, plus he just lost to Logan, so it didn't feel right keeping him above. He didn't
        even have a bad week really, Logan just had a better one, but so far, we haven't seen the top end pop that we thought we'd get consistently
        here. That and the TE position STILL hasn't been ironed out. And Stafford still rostered? Why? Kenneth Walker could be a massive piece going
        forward, though.`

        down: "Raheem Mostert",
        game: "L 89.80",
        upcoming: "Tyler Stock (3-3)",
        blurb: `Yet another ugly loss as Ram notches LOTW and we slide him down to #10 just for funsies. He left a ton of points on the bench
        in a week where even just one of those players starting would have earned him a win. This team needs 2021 JT back in the worst way. 
        Keenan Allen wouldn't hurt either. But most of all, not starting 2 RBs on the same team would be good. Christ.`

                    Upset city in the NFL this week. Rookies are balling. Vets are failing. Times are changing. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The Jets handed the Packers their worst home loss in like 20 years, the Giants made Lamar look like a fool in crunch time,
                    the Vikings are quietly 5-1 after a string of ugly wins, Tom Brady is really going through it, the Cooper Rush magic finally
                    wore off a bit while the Eagles magic didn't, the Bears are B A D, Joe Burreaux returned to his old stomping grounds and stomped,
                    the Bills outlasted the Chiefs in a real letdown of a game, and the Broncos really have issues man. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    We're also seeing a bit of a trend with #1 ranked teams immediately losing. Does that continue this week? Who is the new #1? <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Let's dive in.
